	<h1>ESP-Nia - EEG Signal Processing for the OCZ Nia</h1>
	<h2>Release 1.3, 26-04-14</h2>
	<p>
		This Java library provides the implementation of <a href="http://mrstampy.github.com/ESP/">ESP</a> library classes to acquire the
		raw EEG signal from the OCZ Nia. 
		ESP-Nia was compiled for Java version 1.6 compatibility. The core classes have been designed with speed and concurrency
		in mind using high performance Java libraries:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor">Disruptor</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://javolution.org/">Javolution</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache MINA</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Example classes</h2>

	<h2>Architecture</h2>
	
	<img src="LocalMCSUse.jpg" alt="Local use of the Multi Connection Nia Socket" />
	<p>
		The <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/nia/MultiConnectNiaSocket.html">MultiConnectNiaSocket</a>
		is the core class of this library.  Listeners can register themselves with the socket implementation and will receive the generated
		events as they occur, allowing near-realtime signal acquisition from the device. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But this doesn't explain the 'multi connection' name...
	</p>
	
	<h3>Remote Connection to the Multi Connection Nia Socket</h3>
	<img src="RemoteMCSUse.png" alt="Remote use of the Multi Connection Nia Socket" />
	<p>
		The Multi Connection Nia Socket allows connections from the
		<a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/nia/subscription/NiaSocketConnector.html">NiaSocketConnector</a>.
		Multi connection sockets can accept many such remote connections (theoretically thousands).
		The connections can be running in the same JVM or in different Java programs, even on different computers.  Due to the introduced
		latency resulting from the remote connection the signal received cannot be considered near-realtime, however the socket connector
		is quite useful for highly buffered signals and for applications such as data recorders. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Applications using the socket connector create the connection to the multi connection socket and subscribe to receive 
		device-specific events.  Listeners register themselves with the socket connector and receive the event notifications
		as they are received by the socket connector.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Raw Signal Processing (new in version 1.3)</h3>
	<img src="RawDataProcessing.jpg" alt="Raw data processing"/>
	<p>
		In the development of the <a href="http://mrstampy.github.com/ESP-Nia/">ESP-Nia</a> implementation the base classes
		for raw signal processing were developed.  Multi connection socket implementations contain a raw data buffer which contains
		the current second's worth of data (for the OCZ Nia this translates to 3910 data points, for the ThinkGear devices this translates
		to 512 data points).  A sampler snapshots the buffer at a rate of 100Hz and raw data events are generated from the snapshots
		(for both the Nia and ThinkGear implementations each snapshot consists of 512 evenly spaced data points).
	</p>
	<p>
		Raw data event listeners can make use of <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/nia/dsp/NiaSignalAggregator.html">NiaSignalAggregator</a> 
		which keeps the current second's worth of snapshots in memory (100).  The 
		<a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/nia/dsp/NiaDSP.html">NiaDSP</a> class
		provides the ability to apply signal processing algorithms to the current group of snapshots and notifies any 
		RawProcessedListeners upon completion of each cycle. 
		A <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/nia/dsp/NiaSignalUtilities.html">utility</a> class is provided which contains
		methods which may be useful in processing the raw signal and the ESP library contains classes liberated from 
		<a href="https://github.com/ddf/Minim">Minim</a>
		and <a href="https://github.com/marytts/marytts/">MaryTTS</a> projects which can be used to process the signal.
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal of the ESP raw signal processing is to line the ducks up in a row for processing.  How the signal is 
		processed is up to the application using the library.
