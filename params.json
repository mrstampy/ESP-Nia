The ESP library itself is not an implementation, however there are several implementations for specific EEG devices:\r\n\t\r\n* [ESP-Nia](http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP-Nia/)\r\n* [ESP-ThinkGear](http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP-ThinkGear/)\r\n* [ESP-OpenBCI (experimental)](http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP-OpenBCI/)\r\n* [ESPLab (JavaFX 8.0 GUI for the ESP Lab interface)](http://mrstampy.github.io/ESPLab/)\r\n\t\r\nESP provides a common structure for device specific implementations.  This allows programs using the ESP libraries to cater for multiple devices from a single codebase.\r\n\r\n## Primary Design Specifics\r\n\r\n### [The MultiConnectSocket Interface](https://github.com/mrstampy/ESP/blob/master/ESP/src/com/github/mrstampy/esp/multiconnectionsocket/MultiConnectionSocket.java)\r\n\r\nThis interface defines the methods that must be implemented for a class\twhich provides access to EEG hardware. An [abstract superclass](https://github.com/mrstampy/ESP/blob/master/ESP/src/com/github/mrstampy/esp/multiconnectionsocket/AbstractMultiConnectionSocket.java) exists for ease of implementation.\r\n\r\n### [The RawEspConnection Interface](https://github.com/mrstampy/ESP/blob/master/ESP/src/com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/RawEspConnection.java)\r\n\r\nRawEspConnection extends the MultiConnectSocket interface. Implementations are intended to encapsulate and control a MultiConnectSocket instance through the implementation of the common methods, as well as provide the current seconds' worth of samples on demand for direct use or further processing.  Signal processing methods exist to provide ease of processing the signal.  An [abstract superclass](https://github.com/mrstampy/ESP/blob/master/ESP/src/com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/AbstractRawEspConnection.java) exists for ease of implementation.\r\n\r\n### [The Lab Interface](https://github.com/mrstampy/ESP/blob/master/ESP/src/com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/Lab.java)\r\n\r\nWhile the ESP library provides DSP processing classes, how the signal is processed is left to programs using the library.  Lab implementations provide the ability to obtain the current seconds' worth of samples from the encapsulated RawEspConnection, process the signal and notify the program when a sample is ready for use.\r\n\r\nA [default implementation](https://github.com/mrstampy/ESP/blob/master/ESP/src/com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/DefaultLab.java)\r\nexists and an [abstract superclass](https://github.com/mrstampy/ESP/blob/master/ESP/src/com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/AbstractLab.java) provides ease\r\nof custom lab implementation. \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Direct MultiConnectSocket Usage\r\n\r\nThis is the lowest level use case.  Programs using ESP library implementations in this manner will receive device-specific signals as they occur.  Each implementation of the ESP library's MultiConnectSocket has a device-specific listener mechanism to obtain the signal.  Pseudo code for usage appears as so:\r\n\r\n\t\tMultiConnectNiaSocket socket = new MultiConnectNiaSocket();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// optional, common to all MultiConnectSocket implementations:\r\n\t\t// add a listener to receive connect/disconnect events\r\n\t\tsocket.addConnectionEventListener(new ConnectionEventListener() {\r\n\t\t\tpublic void connectionEventPerformed(ConnectionEvent e) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdoSomethingWith(e);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tsocket.addListener(new NiaEventListener() {\r\n\t\t\tpublic void niaEventPerformed(NiaEvent event) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdoSomethingWith(e);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tsocket.start();\r\n\r\n### Direct MultiConnectSocket Usage - Remote Connection\r\n\r\nThis functionality is from where the MultiConnectSocket derives its name.  Device specific implementations provide the ability to open a socket on a configurable port.  Such sockets facilitate a subscribe and publish of device signals. This allows separate processes and machines to [receive the device signals](https://github.com/mrstampy/ESP/blob/master/ESP/src/com/github/mrstampy/esp/multiconnectionsocket/AbstractSocketConnector.java) for their own purposes - signal recording, secondary processing, display etc.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t// on the host machine or process:\r\n\t\t// port is set via the system property 'socket.broadcaster.port', default '12345'\r\n\t\tMultiConnectNiaSocket socket = new MultiConnectNiaSocket(true);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// on the remote process/machine:\r\n\t\t// port is set via the system property 'socket.broadcaster.port', default '12345'\r\n\t\tNiaSocketConnector connector = new NiaSocketConnector(\"host machine name or IP address\");\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tconnector.addListener(new NiaEventListener() {\r\n\t\t\tpublic void niaEventPerformed(NiaEvent event) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdoSomethingWith(e);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tconnector.connect();\r\n\t\tconnector.subscribe(....);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// and back on the host machine or process:\r\n\t\tsocket.start();\r\n\r\n### RawEspConnection Usage\r\n\r\nRawEspConnection implementations aggregate the current second's worth of data, insulating the program from device specific listeners.  The samples are intended to be queried periodically in a separate scheduled task or thread.  The period of querying is left to the program and is independent of sample rate.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tNiaConnection connection = new NiaConnection();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// optional, common to all RawEspConnection implementations:\r\n\t\t// add a listener to receive connect/disconnect events\r\n\t\tconnection.addConnectionEventListener(new ConnectionEventListener() {\r\n\t\t\tpublic void connectionEventPerformed(ConnectionEvent e) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdoSomethingWith(e);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tconnection.start();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// in a separate scheduled periodic task..\r\n\t\tint channel = 1; // channel of interest \r\n\t\tdealWithCurrentSecondOfSamples(connection.getCurrentFor(channel));\r\n\r\n### Lab Usage\r\n\r\nLab implementations provide the ability to process the current seconds' worth of data from the RawEspConnection and notify any interested parties of its completion. Triggering of signal processing is intended to be executed periodically in a separate scheduled task or thread.  The period of triggering is left to the program and is independent of sample rate.\r\n\r\n\t\tNiaConnection connection = new NiaConnection();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// optional, common to all RawEspConnection implementations:\r\n\t\t// add a listener to receive connect/disconnect events\r\n\t\tconnection.addConnectionEventListener(new ConnectionEventListener() {\r\n\t\t\tpublic void connectionEventPerformed(ConnectionEvent e) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdoSomethingWith(e);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tLab lab = connection.getDefaultLab();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tint numBands = 40; // first 40 bands\r\n\t\tlab.setNumBands(numBands); // must be set\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tint channel = 1; // channel of interest for multichannels\r\n\t\tlab.setChannel(channel); // required if > 1 channel\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tlab.addSignalProcessedListener(new SignalProcessedListener() {\r\n\t\t\tpublic void signalProcessed(double[] processed) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdoSomethingWith(processed);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// other lab values set as appropriate for processing the signal\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tconnection.start();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// in a separate scheduled periodic task..\r\n\t\tlab.triggerProcessing();\r\n\r\n\r\n## Maven Dependency\r\n       <dependency>\r\n           <groupId>com.github.mrstampy</groupId>\r\n           <artifactId>esp-nia</artifactId>\r\n           <version>2.1</version>\r\n       </dependency>\r\n\r\nUsage of the library is straight-forward. One only needs to instantiate the MultiConnectNiaSocket, add a listener, start the socket and deal with the events as they occur.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Connections\r\n\r\nAs implied by the name of the class, the MultiConnectNiaSocket is capable of not only processing Nia messages for a single application but also of broadcasting the messages to separate applications, even on separate machines and devices!\r\n\r\n## Raw Signal Processing (as of version 1.3)\r\n\r\nIn the development of the [ESP-Nia](http://mrstampy.github.com/ESP-Nia/) implementation the base classes for raw signal processing were developed.  Multi connection socket implementations contain a raw data buffer which contains the current second's worth of data (for the OCZ Nia this translates to 3906 data points, for the ThinkGear devices this translates to 512 data points).\r\n\r\nAdditional classes have been added to assist with raw signal processing. The examples shown will work with the NeuroSky raw output however these classes can be used for any DSP work.\r\n\r\nAdditional functionality is described in the JavaDocs.
