It is designed to be fast and efficient, using high performance Java libraries:\r\n\r\n* [Disruptor](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor)\r\n* [Javolution](http://javolution.org/)\r\n* [Apache MINA](http://mina.apache.org/)\r\n\r\n## Maven Dependency\r\n       <dependency>\r\n           <groupId>com.github.mrstampy</groupId>\r\n           <artifactId>esp-nia</artifactId>\r\n           <version>1.3</version>\r\n       </dependency>\r\n\r\nUsage of the library is straight-forward. One only needs to instantiate the MultiConnectNiaSocket, add a listener, start the socket and deal with the events as they occur.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Connections\r\n\r\nAs implied by the name of the class, the MultiConnectNiaSocket is capable of not only processing Nia messages for a single application but also of broadcasting the messages to separate applications, even on separate machines and devices!\r\n\r\n## Raw Signal Processing (as of version 1.3)\r\n\r\nIn the development of the [ESP-Nia](http://mrstampy.github.com/ESP-Nia/) implementation the base classes for raw signal processing were developed.  Multi connection socket implementations contain a raw data buffer which contains the current second's worth of data (for the OCZ Nia this translates to 3910 data points, for the ThinkGear devices this translates to 512 data points).  A sampler snapshots the buffer at a rate of 100Hz and raw data events are generated from the snapshots (for both the ThinkGear and Nia implementations each snapshot consists of 512 evenly spaced data points).\r\n\r\nAdditional classes have been added to assist with raw signal processing. The examples shown will work with the NeuroSky raw output however these classes can be used for any DSP work with low sample sizes (ie. < 1000 samples / sec).  For greater sample sizes the utilization of\tprimitive arrays is recommended.\r\n\r\nAdditional functionality is described in the JavaDocs. This work is released under the GPL 3.0 license. No warranty of any kind is offered.\r\n\r\n[ESP-Nia](http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP-Nia/) Copyright (C) 2014 Burton Alexander. \r\n\r\nOCZ Nia is a trademark of [OCZ](http://www.ocz.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
